This is an implementation of Twilight Struggle written for the open source Saito Game Engine Module. It is intended as a demonstration of running complicated, rules-based games on a blockchain, letting the underlying game engire provide provably-fair dice rolls and deck management.

As a fan of GMT Games and Twilight Struggle, our hope is that this module helps introduce new players to the company and the game, supports the Twilight Struggle community, and encourages the emergence of improved ecosystems for online gaming which will give games publishers like GMT Games more freedom to license their games for direct play on a game-by-game basis if they wish. We strive to make this game as standards-compliant as possible.

Please see the /licence directory for details on legalese. The short version is that the code that implements the game rules is released under the MIT license. All GMT-developed materials (board design, cards, gameplay text) remain owned by GMT Games and are distributed under their own license, which provides for gameplay and distribution under the following conditions:

	1. The game files may only be used by open source, non-commercial game engines

	2. At least ONE player in every game should have purchased a commercial copy of the game.

If you are a player or developer who enjoys playing around with this implementation, please respect the goodwill shown by GMT Games and purchase a copy of the game. Likewise, if you make this demo available for play on a public server, please make sure that any players you support can fulfill these conditions by making it easy for them to purchase commercial copies of the game.
